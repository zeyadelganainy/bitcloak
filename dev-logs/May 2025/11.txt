First thing I'm doing now is learning what is BMP and what LSB is. I broke down this app into a few different steps with the first being embedding a message into the image. To do that, I need to load it, hide the secret message (from .txt), save the new image with the message.

I'm working with 24 bit uncompressed BMP because it seems straightforward. Each pixel is 3B one for each of the rgb channels and it's stored by row top to bottom and I can access each pixel data directly.
