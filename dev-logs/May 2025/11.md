# 🧠 Bitcloak — Phase 1: Core Steganography Engine (Single-Threaded)
### 🚀 _Learning Log & Developer Notes_

---

## ✅ 1. Project Goals
- Build a systems-level tool to hide/extract secret messages in image files using **LSB (Least Significant Bit)** steganography.
- Use **C** for low-level control and prepare for **parallel acceleration** (OpenMP, CUDA).
- Ensure the project is portfolio-ready with modular code, a command-line interface, and clean structure.

---

## ✅ 2. LSB Steganography: What I Learned
- Every byte of image data (R, G, B) has 8 bits — the **last bit** can be modified without visibly changing the pixel.
- By storing 1 bit of a message in each LSB, we can hide entire strings in an image.
- We embed a **null terminator (`\0`)** at the end to know when to stop during extraction.

---

## ✅ 3. BMP Format Knowledge
- Chose **24-bit uncompressed BMPs** for simplicity — each pixel = 3 bytes (RGB).
- Learned how to:
  - Read BMP headers (`BITMAPFILEHEADER` and `BITMAPINFOHEADER`)
  - Load raw pixel data using `fread`
  - Handle **row padding** (BMP rows align to 4-byte boundaries)

---

## ✅ 4. Code Modules & Structure
Organized the project with a clear layout:

```
bitcloak/
├── src/           # All .c implementation files
├── include/       # All .h header files
├── assets/        # BMP test images and message outputs
├── Makefile       # Build automation
```

Files:
- `embed.c` / `embed.h`: Hide message into pixel LSBs
- `extract.c` / `extract.h`: Reconstruct message from pixel LSBs
- `image_io.c` / `image_io.h`: Load/save BMP images
- `main.c`: CLI entry point

---

## ✅ 5. Makefile & Build System
- Learned to automate compilation with a `Makefile`
- Discovered that **Makefiles require tab characters** for command lines
- Installed `make` and added it to Windows `PATH`
- Built the project into `bitcloak.exe` using:
  ```bash
  make
  ```

---

## ✅ 6. CLI Development
Built a CLI with 2 commands:
```bash
# Embed
bitcloak embed -i assets/cover.bmp -m "secret message" -o assets/stego.bmp

# Extract
bitcloak extract -i assets/stego.bmp -o assets/message.txt
```

Handled:
- Argument parsing (`-i`, `-o`, `-m`)
- Error validation
- Output feedback to the user

---

## ✅ 7. Testing
- Created a valid 24-bit BMP (`cover.bmp`) as the base
- Verified that messages can be embedded and extracted cleanly
- Successfully wrote to and read from `message.txt`

---

## 🧩 Coming Next (Phase 2 Ideas)
- ⚡ Add **OpenMP** to parallelize the embed/extract loops
- 🔐 Add **XOR or AES encryption** before embedding
- 📂 Add support for **file embedding**, not just strings
- 🖼️ Add a **simple GUI** or **REST API**
- 📊 Benchmark performance with large images
